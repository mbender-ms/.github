## Master index

See categories-index.yml for the complete category list with exact repo counts.

## Usage

1. Identify the product area from the article's ms.service or content.

3. Load the full YAML file only when you need repo-level detail.
4. For most fact-checking, category is sufficient to scope microsoft_docs_search.
