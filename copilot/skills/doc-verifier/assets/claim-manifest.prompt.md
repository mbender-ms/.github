# Claim Manifest Extractor

Read a Microsoft documentation article and produce a **structured claim manifest** — every verifiable technical assertion cataloged by type, service area, and line number. No MCP calls, no verification. Pure text analysis.

This is a lightweight helper. Use it to:
- Pre-stage claims before running fan-out verification
- Audit an article's claim density before deciding on depth
- Generate a manifest for external tools or scripts to consume

## Step 1 — Read the article

Read the file. Extract from frontmatter:
- `title`
- `ms.service` / `ms.prod`
- `ms.topic`
- `ms.date`

Scan for `[!INCLUDE ...]` references. Read and catalog include files.

## Step 2 — Extract claims

Walk every line. A **verifiable claim** is any statement that can be confirmed or denied by checking official Microsoft documentation. Extract:

### Claim types

| Type | What to look for | Examples |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| `feature` | Capability or behavior assertions | "supports HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP" |
| `config` | Default values, settings, thresholds | "default interval is 15 seconds" |
| `api` | REST API endpoints, parameters, responses | "PUT /subscriptions/{id}/..." |
| `cli` | Azure CLI or PowerShell commands and flags | "az network lb probe create --protocol" |
| `code` | Code examples, SDK usage, syntax | "new BlobServiceClient(connectionString)" |
| `limit` | Quotas, maximums, rate limits | "max 1000 rules per NSG" |
| `pricing` | Cost, tier, SKU information | "Standard tier starts at $0.025/hour" |
| `status` | Preview/GA/deprecated/retired status | "currently in public preview" |
| `link` | URLs to other docs, tools, or resources | "https://learn.microsoft.com/..." |
| `prereq` | Required versions, tools, permissions | "requires Azure CLI 2.50+" |

### What is NOT a claim

Skip these — they're not verifiable against docs:
- Subjective guidance ("we recommend...", "consider using...")
- Structural text ("in this article, you learn how to...")
- Navigation text ("see Related content below")
- Generic descriptions that don't assert specific facts

## Step 3 — Group by service area

Assign each claim to a service area based on content. Use `ms.service` as the primary indicator but override if a claim clearly belongs to a different service.

Common service areas:
- Azure Networking (Load Balancer, App Gateway, Front Door, Firewall, VNet, DNS, etc.)
- Azure Compute (VMs, VMSS, AKS, Container Apps, Functions, App Service, etc.)
- Azure Identity (Entra ID, RBAC, Managed Identity, Key Vault, etc.)
- Azure Storage (Blob, Files, Queue, Table, Data Lake, etc.)
- Azure Data (SQL, Cosmos DB, Synapse, Data Factory, etc.)
- Azure AI (OpenAI, Cognitive Services, ML, etc.)
- Azure DevOps (Pipelines, Boards, Repos, Artifacts, etc.)
- M365 (Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, etc.)
- Security (Defender, Sentinel, Purview, Intune, etc.)
- Cross-service (general Azure concepts, portal, ARM, Bicep, etc.)

## Step 4 — Output the manifest

Create `claims_[articlename]_YYYYMMDD.md`:

```markdown
# Claim Manifest: [Article Title]

**File**: [path]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**ms.service**: [value]
**ms.topic**: [value]
**ms.date**: [value]
**Total claims**: [count]
**Include files**: [count] resolved

## Claim density

| Service area | Claims | Types |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| [area] | N | feature(X), config(Y), cli(Z) |
| [area] | N | ... |

## Claims by service area

### [Service Area 1] ([N] claims)

| ID | Line | Type | Claim text | Include file |
|----|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| C001 | 23 | feature | "Health probes support HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP" | — |
| C002 | 31 | config | "Default probe interval is 15 seconds" | — |
| C003 | 45 | cli | "az network lb probe create --protocol Https" | — |
| C004 | 52 | code | "`New-AzLoadBalancerProbeConfig -Protocol Tcp`" | — |

### [Service Area 2] ([N] claims)

| ID | Line | Type | Claim text | Include file |
|----|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| C009 | 78 | feature | "VNet peering supports cross-region connectivity" | — |

### Links ([N] links)

| ID | Line | URL | Context |
|----|------|-----|---------|
| L001 | 12 | https://learn.microsoft.com/... | Prerequisites link |
| L002 | 89 | https://learn.microsoft.com/... | Related content |

## Include files resolved

| Include path | Claims extracted | Service area |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| ~/includes/clean-up-resources.md | 0 | — |
```

## Step 5 — Present summary

In chat, provide:
- Total claims and breakdown by type
- Largest service-area group (this will be the heaviest subagent)
- Any red flags: very old `ms.date`, missing frontmatter, broken include paths
- Estimated verification effort: "This article has N claims across M service areas → M parallel subagents needed"

## Usage with other workflows

### As input to fan-out-verify

```
1. Run claim-manifest on the article
2. Review the manifest (adjust groupings if needed)
3. Run fan-out-verify — it will use the same grouping logic
```

### As input to fleet-batch-verify

```
1. Run claim-manifest on each article in the batch
2. Review claim density to prioritize (highest-claim articles first)
3. Run /fleet with the prioritized list
```

### Standalone audit

Use the manifest to assess documentation quality without running full verification:
- High claim density + old `ms.date` = high staleness risk
- Many `api` or `cli` claims = high breakage risk from API changes
- Many `link` claims = link rot risk
